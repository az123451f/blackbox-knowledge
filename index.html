                    <h4>🔐 New Dedicated Staff Channels</h4>
                    <p>We're launching exclusive, staff-moderated channels where only verified staff can post. These channels will feature:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>High-quality, structured teaching (no clutter or off-topic chats)</li>
                        <li>Curated resources for skill-building, mentorship, and deep dives</li>
                        <li>Zero noise—pure value for serious learners</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Think of it as your premium learning hub!</p>
                    
                    <h4>🌱 New Community Category: "Open Growth Space"</h4>
                    <p>Alongside staff channels, we're introducing a vibrant community zone for peer-driven connection:</p>
